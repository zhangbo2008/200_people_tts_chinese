## Training Classes

*Note: This material has been designed to be taught in a classroom environment. The code is well commented but missing some of the contextual concepts and ideas that will be covered in class.*

### Ultimate Go

This class teaches how to write better, more idiomatic and performant code in Go with a focus on micro-level engineering decisions  At the very beginning of class, the instructor will focus on Go internals that are critical to understanding the core tradeoffs the language makes on readability, simplicity and performance. The class builds layers of foundational knowledge that will give you a deeper understanding into data semantics, decoupling, concurrency and tooling. Perfect for developers just starting out or developers with years of Go experience. Everyone will be writing better code after this class.

### Ultimate Service

This class teaches how to build production-level services in Go with a focus on macro-level engineering decisions. From the beginning you will pair program with the instructor, walking through the design philosophies and guidelines used to engineer the code. With each new feature, you will learn more about the transition from programming to engineering and the points of refactoring required to write production level applications. Throughout the class, Go modules and Kubernetes will be a focus. Everyone will be making better engineering decisions after this class.
